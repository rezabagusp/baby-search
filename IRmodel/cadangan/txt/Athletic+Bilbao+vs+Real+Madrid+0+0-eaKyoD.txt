Madrid were on top for most of the night and really should have come away with a win, but, once again, they failed to carve out enough clear-cut chances and were unable to break down a stubborn Athletic back line.The draw is certainly a better result for Athletic than it is for Madrid, and it moves them up to 15th place in the table, six points clear of the relegation zone. The point means Madrid are back in fourth spot once again after temporarily dropping below Sevilla, but they're equal on points with the Andalusian club and are eight behind league leaders Barcelona.Real Madrid's goalscoring concerns arose once more in a scoreless draw away to Athletic Bilbao.Real Madrid had Sergio Ramos sent off late on and wasted a chance to gain ground in the LaLiga title race with a frustrating 0-0 draw against struggling Athletic Bilbao at San Mames on Saturday.Barcelona's earlier draw at home to Celta Vigo gave Los Blancos the opportunity to cut the gap in LaLiga to six points, but a recurrence of their wayward finishing was largely to blame for a failure to secure victory.Cristiano Ronaldo and Toni Kroos were both guilty for letting chances slip in the first half, while the contest might have been different had Karim Benzema not hit the post in just the eighth minute.Defying the form that has seen them tumble to a concerning 15th, Athletic remained competitive throughout and were not without opportunities to snatch what would have been just a fourth win of the league campaign.Instead, they will have to be content with an encouraging draw that slightly eases the mounting pressure on manager Jose Angel Ziganda.The champions, meanwhile, remain eight points adrift of rivals Barca, although the draw was enough to nudge back into fourth ahead of next weekend's opponents Sevilla  a match Ramos will miss following his second yellow for an elbow on Aritz Aduriz."}
